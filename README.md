# LOC_K_Means_Killers

This repository contains a robust system for real-time event extraction, categorization, and the creation of a dynamic network graph using news data sourced from public APIs, including Airrchip. The system employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLM) to tag, categorize, and analyze news events, constructing a network graph that visualizes the relationships between different events.

Features:

Continuous retrieval of news data from public sources and Airrchip APIs.

Utilization of NLP techniques and LLM for event tagging, categorization, and analysis.

Construction of a dynamic network graph using the networkx library.

Application of network analysis techniques to determine the significance of event connections.

Intuitive user interface for interactive exploration and visualization of the network graph.
